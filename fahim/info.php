            Technogym training experience at Waterfront Costa Smeralda
        </div>

        <div class="desc">
            From 29th June to 5th September, Technogym, the world's leading Italian company in fitness, wellness, and
            sport, will be present with a dedicated space inside Waterfront,
            a luxury village hosting the most important luxury and lifestyle brands. This is an experiential space
            designed to discover and experience the Wellness lifestyle at 360°.
            Every day, Technogym Master Trainers will be available for two training sessions, in the morning and in the
            late afternoon, in the beautiful setting of Porto Cervo Marina.
            To register for the classes, you'll need to download the Technogym App,
            Technogym's training app that, every day, proposes the workout best suited to you by combining scientific
            research, artificial intelligence, and engaging and challenging video content.
            At that point, those enrolled in the classes will be able to do a dedicated workout using the exclusive
            Technogym equipment to continue training, even on holiday.
            The stars of the space at Waterfront are the products from Personal Line, the exclusive line resulting from
            the collaboration between
            Technogym and Antonio Citterio's signature design, including Kinesis, the Technogym design icon, which
            offers the
            possibility of performing more than 200 exercises in less than one square meter of space to train strength,
            balance, and flexibility.

            Inside the Technogym space, visitors will also be able to discover the brand new Technogym Ride, the indoor
            bike designed with champions for cyclist training.
            The 22" screen allows for an immersive indoor experience and, with a single log-in, convenient access to
            favorite apps and workout content, and Technogym Bench,
            the innovative design bench for functional and strength training, designed to combine maximum workout
            variety with minimum footprint.
            Technogym at Waterfront consolidates the brand's presence in Costa Smeralda thanks to its ten-year
            partnership with the Yacht Club Costa Smeralda and its presence in the most prestigious hotels.

            Strength is back as a hot trend: Technogym launches Biostrength
        </div>

        <div class="desc">
            Strength training – or resistance training – is that macro-category of anaerobic exercise which implies
            muscle activity
            to oppose an external load. The basic mechanism at the core of strength training involves using muscle
            strength to fight back an external
            resistance: barbell weights, dumbbells, kettlebells or any gym equipment specific for certain muscle groups.
            In undergoing such dynamic
            , stimulated muscles go through a series of micro-damages, which are then fixed and repaired by the body
            through proteins. Over time,
            the loads used will have to be gradually increased to ensure a growing stimulation and the consequent
            adaptation of the body and muscle structure:
            with consistency, the end result is a bigger and stronger muscle.
            After strength training’s golden age in the 80s, in recent years its trend is living a huge comeback.
            Strength training doesn’t necessarily mean powerlifting and bodybuilding, though. In fact, besides the
            aesthetic reasons linked to muscle definition and appearance, the causes of this return are to be traced in
            physical wellbeing and in a better quality of life: strength training boosts bone density, muscle endurance
            and texture, it improves metabolism, general posture, ligaments, tendons and joints condition,
            cardiovascular and nervous health, it helps balance body composition (lean mass / fat mass / muscle mass);
            strength training also enhances all sports performance, making you faster and more athletic, and it also
            gives a great contribution in post-injury recovery and physical reconditioning.
